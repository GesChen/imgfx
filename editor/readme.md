# image editor 
uses custom scripting language to load and manipulate images like traditional image editors, running the main "gui" should give you a live preview of the resulting image. 

.ed files for "edit", basically python syntax

all numbers are floats for compatability with functions (minimize errors from passing int when expecting float)
